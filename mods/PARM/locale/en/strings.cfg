[entity-description]
parm-combinator=A combinator that measures changes in resources and estimates time in minutes until a given target is met.\n\n[In] Red: Values to measure. Once seen resources persist and continue being calculated.\n\n[In] Green:\n - T: target value 0-* [0].\n - S: smoothing factor 1-10 [2].\n - U: update rate in secs 1-* [20].\n - D: time divisor 1=secs, 60=mins, 3600=hrs [60].\n - L: upper display limit [MAXINT].\n - M: mode: 1: predictor, 2: speedometer [1].\n\n[Out] Red/Green: Depends on mode.\n- Predictor: Time until target is met for each input signal.\n- Speedometer: Current change speed of each input signal.\n
