[entity-description]
capacity-time-estimator=A combinator that measures changes in capacity and estimates time in minutes until a given target is met.\n\n[In] Red: Values to measure.\n[In] Green:\n - T: target value 0-* [0].\n - S: smoothing factor 1-10 [2].\n - U: update rate in secs 1-* [20].\n - D: time divisor 1=secs, 60=mins, 3600=hrs [60].\n\n[Out] Red/Green: Time until target is met for each input signal.
